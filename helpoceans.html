     <font face="Verdana" size="5">8 Things you can start doing NOW to help the Oceans wildlife survive the polluted mess they are dealing with!</font>
     <ol>
     <li><font face="verdana" size="3">Stop using Plastic! 90% of the pieces of trash in the oceans are plastic!</font></li>
      <li><font face="verdana" size="3">Don't release balloons into the sky! Both the strings AND the actual balloon part end up in the oceans eventually and harm marine life.</font></li>
       <li><font face="verdana" size="3">Don't use straws! They hurt marine life quite a bit. Plus, it's super easy to avoid straws. Just don't ask for them at a resturaunt or don't buy them. You can even use metal straws.</font></li>
        <li><font face="verdana" size="3">When you buy a six or twelve pack of a beverage, it usually comes in those plastic ring things, right? If you don't cut them before you trash these away, they can end up strangling birds and marine life.</font></li>
         <li><font face="verdana" size="3">Reduce toxins that you use in your yard! These can be fertilizer, weed killer, or other toxic materials your pour into your lawn. These can harm you, just like the marine animals by making their way into your water supply! Yuck!</font></li>
          <li><font face="verdana" size="3">Use reusable shopping bags when you grocery shop! Grocery bags can end up just like the six-pack-ring-things as soon as they get a hole in them, choking marine life as well as birds.</font></li>
           <li><font face="verdana" size="3">Recycle! That's all you have to do! You can even get money from grocery stores by turning in cans and bottles! It's that simple!</font></li>
            <li><font face="verdana" size="3">Lastly, follow the 4-R's. <strong>Recycle, Reuse, Refuse, and Reduce.</strong></font></li>
     </ol>
